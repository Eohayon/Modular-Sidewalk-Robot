# Modular-Sidewalk-Robot
During one of my Co-Op terms, I worked with a team at an emerging startup to develop a modular sidewalk robot. During the winter, the robot is able to plow snow and spread salt on the sidewalks. During the summer, it is used for lawn mowing, sidewalk inspections and delivery. The robot has a 360Â° field of view, and can be remotely operated or operate itself autonomously. It is also equipped with a microphone and speakers, in order to communicate with pedestrians, and emergency stop buttons as a fail-safe stopping system. I worked on all aspects of the robot, including, mechanical design, drivetrain, electrical design, soldering and assembly.
